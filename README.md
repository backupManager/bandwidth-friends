# bandwidth-friends

A shell script for macOS that makes sure you are being nice to your nice coffeeshop internet neighbors. ðŸ’–

If you go over the set limit of bandwidth usage in a thirty second period, your
computer will issue a nice little notice to everyone around you.

See *blawg post* for more.
